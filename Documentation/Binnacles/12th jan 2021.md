Today we had a meeting with Raul Rivadeneyra, a fellow software engineering student, where he guided us on the topic of UI and UX. We talked about how to approach the design and prototyping stages of a real-world application. He also gave us some UI design resources, and some advice based on his experience as a higher year student. This meeting will definitely help us deliver a better overall product.

Additionally, with the creation of this progress log, we have now officially started the final increment of our project.
