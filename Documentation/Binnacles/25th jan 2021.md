Today we focused on finishing our article. According to commit this, we revised the different artifacts that were created in previous increments, we 
analysed all the information and wrote the article emphazising all the stages of the project and the trazability between early stage of the project where
we elicite requirements and the high-fidelity prototype. Finally we wrote our conclusions and our views about the signature.
