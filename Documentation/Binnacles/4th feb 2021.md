Today we showed our mentor the final version of our articleÂ´s poster. A few days ago we had shown him our progress but he told us that in order to make it perfect, we had to make some changes. So, following his recommendations, we updated the design and today we showed it to him again. He told us that it had improved and that he liked the way it looked. This was very satisfying for us because we had already made several versions of the design and, also, having his approval marks the conclusion of this stage and now we can move on to the final stage of the project, the presentation video.
