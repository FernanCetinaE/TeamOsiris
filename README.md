# Description

Our project intends to help students manage their time, keep track of their future activities and allow them to retrieve time missed. For this purpose, we will develop a tool that allows its users to add and remove objectives. It will also have several options to keep track of them with constant notifications, progress updates and a tool that helps them find a path to complete those activities they missed without overlapping with new tasks.

# Users

Our project is intended to help students of 1st semester of UADY studying Software Engineering.

# Our Process vs. Scrum

For our process development, we adhere to the Scrum agile-framework. In this section, we point out the differences between our development process and an ideal Scrum framework.

## User stories:

We decided not to implement user stories. Instead, we opted for requirements. The main reason for this is the difficulty of creating different user stories that attend to the numerous preferences that might exist for the product. Because of this, we try to make our product's requirements be as clear as possible and make them answer to the recollected information of the surveys.

## Sprint

Along with the sprint, we agree on the days when we will have "daily meetings". These meetings are made whenever they are necessary in order to evaluate our progress, analyze the possible uncertainties, or just solve doubts. We also implemented the verification as a phase called "quality assurance" and it is a fundamental part of the daily meeting.

## Product Backlog

In our product backlog, we considered the main features and requirements of the product. We did not consider other factors, like technical risks or system performance.

## Product owner and customer

According to Scrum, the product owner/customer should be actively involved in the development process, but we could not comply with this because we are developing a stand-alone project. Despite this, we appointed our primary users as the product-owners in our development process.
