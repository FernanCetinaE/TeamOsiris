Yesterday we had a meeting with our mentor, which was extremely helpful. Recently we have had occasions where we've felt slightly blocked in terms of our vision of the project. But our mentor made us realize several problems we had, and now we believe that we have a more defined objective in mind.

What we have done is go back into a more abstract definition of our project that we will expand and mature during our development process.

# Pending
* Keep defining the characteristics of our project.
* Finish our project presentation that is due on the 30th of November.
